NAME
    DBIx::DBO2::Docs::ReadMe - Getting Started with DBIx::DBO2

SYNOPSIS
      package MyRecord;
      use DBIx::DBO2::Record '-isasubclass';
      my $sql_engine = DBIx::SQLEngine->new( $dsn, $user, $pass );
  
      MyRecord->table(
        DBIx::DBO2::Table->new(name=>'myrecords', datasource=>$sql_engine)
      );
  
      package main;
      my $results = MyRecord->fetch_all;
      foreach my $record ( $results->records ) {
        if ( $record->{age} > 20 ) {
          $record->{status} = 'adult';
          $record->save_row;
        }
      }

DESCRIPTION
    DBIx::DBO2 is an object-relational mapping framework that facilitates
    the development of Perl classes whose objects are stored in a SQL
    database table.

INSTALLING
    You should be able to install this module using the CPAN shell
    interface:

      perl -MCPAN -e 'install DBIx::DBO2'

    If this module has not yet been posted to your local CPAN mirror, you
    may also retrieve the current distribution from the below address and
    follow the normal "gunzip", "tar xf", "cd", "perl Makefile.PL && make
    test && sudo make install" procedure or your local equivalent:

      http://www.evoscript.org/DBIx-DBO2/

  Getting Started

    You may want to take a look at the test.pl and test-lib/ classes
    included with this distribution for a short example of how to use this
    framework to create your own classes.

  Prerequisites

    Requires DBIx::SQLEngine and Class::MakeMethods, both available on CPAN.

  Tested Platforms

    This release has been tested succesfully on the following platforms:

      5.6.1 on darwin
      5.005_03 on i386-freebsd

VERSION
    This is version 0.006 of DBIx::DBO2.

  Distribution Summary

    This module's summary in the CPAN DSLIP is intended to read:

      Name            DSLIP  Description
      --------------  -----  ---------------------------------------------
      DBIx::
      ::DBO2          bdpOp  Objects mapping to SQL relational structures

  Beta Release

    Although it based on earlier code that was extensively tested over
    several years of production use, this code has recently been majorly
    refactored, and has not yet been sufficiently tested in its new form.

    See the DBIx::SQLEngine manpage for information about the underlying
    database interface.

    See the DBIx::DBO2::Comparison manpage for a a review of where this
    framework fits into the spectrum of numerous other modules on CPAN that
    provide alternative systems to map objects to and from SQL databases,
    including the Class::DBI manpage, the Alzabo manpage, and the Tangram
    manpage.
