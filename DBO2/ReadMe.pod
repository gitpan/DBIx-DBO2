=head1 NAME

DBIx::DBO2::ReadMe - Getting Started with DBIx::DBO2


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyRecord;
  use DBIx::DBO2::Record '-isasubclass';
  my $sql_engine = DBIx::SQLEngine->new( $dsn, $user, $pass );
  
  MyRecord->table(
    DBIx::DBO2::Table->new(name=>'myrecords', datasource=>$sql_engine)
  );
  
  package main;
  my $results = MyRecord->fetch_all;
  foreach my $record ( $results->records ) {
    if ( $record->{age} > 20 ) {
      $record->{status} = 'adult';
      $record->save_row;
    }
  }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

DBIx::DBO2 is an object-relational mapping framework (or perhaps
a relational-object mapping framework, if I understand the distinction
correctly) that facilitates the development of Perl classes whose
objects are stored in a SQL database table.

=head2 Getting Started

You may want to take a look at the test.pl and test-lib/ classes
included with this distribution for a short example of how to use
this framework to create your own classes.

=head2 Prerequisites

Requires DBIx::SQLEngine and Class::MakeMethods, both available on CPAN.
