NAME
    DBIx::DBO2::ToDo - Tasks, ideas, and bug reports

TODO
    *   Records should be using prototypes for new(), to simplify both
        setting defaults and changing the default implementation class.

    *   Complete Fields development.

        Integrate fields generation and column definitions to simplify
        subclass declarations.

    *   Move most of the primary key logic into primary_key field
        declarations, including fetch_id.

    *   Finish building out field auto-detection to include on-demand method
        generation.

    *   Fix RecordSet filtering and sorting.

    *   Replace Record::DefinedRow with Table::Static.

    *   Former versions of this package used the DBO::* namespace, but this
        is a poor choice for public redistribution, ie CPAN. But what would
        be a better name for this framework? Some candidates:

          DBIx::DBO2
          DBIx::ORM

    *   Move all of the AUTHORS and LICENSE blocks to ReadMe.pod Include a
        SEE ALSO in all modules pointing to ReadMe.pod.
